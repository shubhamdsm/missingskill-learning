## LINUX

**HISTORY OF LINUX**


- The Unix operating system was developed in 1970 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in Bell LABS.
- In the year 1997 Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was released. It was free software that had UNIX code in it so they were sued by the Bell LABS.
- In the year 1991 Linux Torvalds developed the Linux kernel and it was open source so anybody can use the software.
- The first Linux based operating system was called GNU/Linux which was released by a free software foundation.

 **TERMINAL AND SHELL**
 
- Terminal and shell is an application in Linux which work as a command interpreter.
- By interpreter means it will get a command from the user and it is executed from the operating system.
- This feature was taken over from the UNIX operating system.

1. Debian 
2. Red Hat
3. Arch
4. Ubuntu
5. Andriod
6. Fedora
